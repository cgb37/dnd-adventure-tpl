<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Once known as Zarok Greenleaf, this powerful druid was a contemporary of Thorvald One-Eye in their younger days. Both studied under the same circle of druids in the ancient forests bordering Veldan. While Thorvald embraced the balance of nature and the interconnectedness of all things, Zarok became fascinated with the darker aspects of the natural world - decay, disease, and the survival of the fittest.</p>

<p>During a ritual to commune with the spirit of an ancient, dying forest, Zarok had a vision of a world where nature reclaimed civilization, where the strong thrived and the weak perished. This vision twisted his perspective, leading him to believe that the current balance of nature was flawed and that true strength could only be achieved through struggle and corruption.</p>

<h3>The Blighting</h3>
<p>Zarok's experiments with corrupting plant and animal life led to his exile from the druid circle. As he delved deeper into forbidden knowledge, his body began to change. His skin took on a sickly, mottled appearance, and thorny protrusions emerged from his flesh. Plants withered in his presence, and animals fled from his approach. Thus, he became known as Zarok the Blighted.</p>

<h3>Motivations</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To "strengthen" the natural world through corruption and conflict</li>
    <li>To prove the superiority of his twisted version of nature over the traditional druidic view</li>
    <li>To gain power and influence by manipulating the balance of nature</li>
    <li>To thwart Thorvald's plans and prove him wrong about the prophecy</li>
</ul>

<h3>Allies</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Corrupted beasts and plants that he has "enhanced" through his dark druidic magic</li>
    <li>A cult of misguided individuals who believe his way will lead to a stronger world</li>
    <li>Some of King Hrothgar's more paranoid advisors, who see Zarok as a useful tool against Thorvald</li>
    <li>Darker fey creatures who are drawn to the chaos he sows</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enemies</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Thorvald One-Eye, his primary nemesis and philosophical opposite</li>
    <li>The Circle of Druids that exiled him</li>
    <li>Nature spirits and uncorrupted wildlife</li>
    <li>Those who seek to maintain the balance of nature</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To corrupt the heart of Veldan's ancient forests, turning them into a twisted reflection of his ideals</li>
    <li>To prevent the reunion of Hrothgar and Einar, seeing their potential unity as a threat to the chaos he desires</li>
    <li>To discredit Thorvald and prove that his visions of the future are flawed</li>
    <li>To create a new breed of life that thrives on corruption and spreads his influence</li>
</ul>

<h3>Role in Thrones of the Forsaken</h3>
<p>Zarok serves as a wild card in the conflict between Hrothgar and Einar. He sees the potential reunification of the brothers as a threat to his plans, as a strong, unified Veldan would be better equipped to resist the spread of his corruption.</p>

<p>He works behind the scenes to exacerbate the conflict between the brothers, using his corrupted minions to stage attacks that heighten tensions. Zarok may initially appear to be allied with Hrothgar's forces, offering his "aid" in combating the threat of Einar's return. However, his true goal is to weaken both sides and create chaos that he can exploit.</p>

<h3>Plot Hooks</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Strange, diseased wildlife begins attacking villages on the outskirts of Veldan. Investigation leads to traces of Zarok's corruption.</li>
    <li>A group of refugees fleeing from a "cursed forest" seeks help, describing symptoms that match Zarok's blight.</li>
    <li>Thorvald tasks the players with finding and protecting a rare, pure spring of water that Zarok seeks to corrupt.</li>
    <li>King Hrothgar's advisors recommend seeking the aid of a "powerful druid" (Zarok) to combat Einar's forces, unaware of his true nature.</li>
    <li>A series of assassinations targeting key figures supporting Einar's claim are found to have been carried out by corrupted beasts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lore and Notes</h3>
<h4>The Blight's Manifestation</h4>
<p>Zarok's corruption manifests differently in various forms of life:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Plants become thorny, poisonous, and aggressive, actively seeking to entangle and harm living creatures.</li>
    <li>Animals grow extra limbs, eyes, or other mutations that make them more deadly but often shorten their lifespans.</li>
    <li>Humanoids who willingly accept his "gift" gain unnatural strength and resilience but slowly lose their sanity.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Prophecy's Twist</h4>
<p>Zarok believes he has discovered a hidden aspect of the prophecy that speaks of a "rotting crown" that will "seed the land with strength." He interprets this as validation of his beliefs and actions.</p>

<h4>Zarok's Lair</h4>
<p>Deep in the corrupted part of the forest lies Zarok's lair, a twisted grove where the lines between plant and animal blur. The very air is thick with spores that can infect the unwary, and the ground pulses with an unsettling, sickly life of its own.</p>

<h3>DM Notes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Zarok should be introduced gradually, first through the effects of his actions rather than direct confrontation.</li>
    <li>His true identity and connection to Thorvald can be revealed as a major plot twist.</li>
    <li>The extent of his influence in Hrothgar's court can be adjusted based on the players' actions and the campaign's progression.</li>
    <li>Zarok's corruption could be used as a ticking clock element - the longer the conflict between Hrothgar and Einar continues, the more his blight spreads.</li>
    <li>Consider giving players tough moral choices regarding Zarok's victims - can corrupted creatures be saved, or is a mercy killing the only option?</li>
</ul>
