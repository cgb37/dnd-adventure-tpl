  <h2>Basic Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Name:</strong> Thorvald One-Eye</li>
    <li><strong>Race:</strong> Half-Elf</li>
    <li><strong>Class:</strong> Druid (Circle of Visions)</li>
    <li><strong>Age:</strong> 174 (appears to be in his late 60s by human standards)</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Feature:</strong> Missing left eye, replaced by a mystical orb of swirling mist</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Thorvald was born to a human mother and an elven father, inheriting the longevity of his elven heritage and the adaptability of his human side. His early years were spent in the ancient forests bordering Veldan, where he was trained in the druidic arts by a reclusive circle of nature priests.</p>
  <p>In his youth, Thorvald's exceptional gift for divination caught the attention of King Bjorn Ironheart. The king, always seeking ways to secure his realm's future, invited Thorvald to serve as a royal advisor. Thorvald accepted, seeing it as an opportunity to guide the kingdom towards harmony with nature and the fulfillment of its destiny.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>The Loss of an Eye, the Gain of Insight</h2>
  <p>During a ritual to divine the future of the Ironheart line, Thorvald experienced a vision so powerful it physically manifested, causing him to lose his left eye. In its place, a mystical orb formed, swirling with misty visions of possible futures. This event marked Thorvald as a true seer and earned him the moniker "One-Eye."</p>
  <p>The loss of his eye and gain of prophetic power came with a heavy price: Thorvald's visions became more frequent and intense, often blurring the lines between present and future, reality and possibility. This made him appear erratic and unreliable to those unaware of his gift's nature.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Service to the Crown</h2>
  <p>For decades, Thorvald served as King Bjorn's most trusted advisor. His counsel, though often cryptic, helped guide Veldan through numerous crises. He was present for the birth of the twin princes, Hrothgar and Einar, and it was his interpretation of the prophecy that led to the fateful decision to separate them.</p>
  <p>As Hrothgar grew and prepared to take the throne, tensions arose between the young prince and the aging advisor. Hrothgar, focused on military might and tangible power, often dismissed Thorvald's warnings about the balance of nature and the importance of fulfilling the realm's mystical destiny.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Exile and Return</h2>
  <p>Shortly after Hrothgar's coronation, Thorvald chose to leave the court. Some say he was banished by the new king, who saw his prophecies as a threat. Others believe Thorvald left of his own accord, driven by visions of a future he needed to help shape from afar.</p>
  <p>For years, Thorvald wandered the lands beyond Veldan, watching over Einar from a distance and preparing for the day when the twins' paths would cross again. His reputation during this time varied wildly depending on who you asked:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To some, he was a wise sage, offering guidance to those in need.</li>
    <li>Others saw him as a madman, raving about prophecies and impending doom.</li>
    <li>Some whispered that he was a powerful druid, capable of communing with nature in ways long forgotten.</li>
    <li>A few even claimed he was a charlatan, using cheap tricks to pretend at mystical foresight.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Current Role</h2>
  <p>Now, as the prophecy he long ago interpreted begins to unfold, Thorvald has returned to Veldan. He seeks to reunite the twin princes and guide them towards their shared destiny, hoping to correct what he sees as his greatest mistake.</p>
  <p>Thorvald's reputation remains a matter of perspective:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To Einar's supporters, he is a link to the true heritage of the "lost prince" and a symbol of hope for change.</li>
    <li>To Hrothgar's loyalists, he is a traitor who abandoned his post and now seeks to undermine the rightful king.</li>
    <li>To the common people, he is a figure of mystery and potential - either a harbinger of a brighter future or a dangerous radical, depending on their view of the current regime.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>The Eye of the Beholder</h2>
  <p>Thorvald's mystical eye is a source of both power and controversy. Those who look into it often see visions of their own - glimpses of possible futures or reflections of their deepest fears and desires. This has led to widely varying accounts of Thorvald's abilities and intentions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some claim the eye can see the absolute truth of any situation, cutting through lies and deception.</li>
    <li>Others believe it shows only what Thorvald wants people to see, a tool for manipulation and control.</li>
    <li>There are tales of the eye granting Thorvald the ability to see through the eyes of animals and plants, giving him an unparalleled network of spies.</li>
    <li>A few whisper that the eye is a conduit to otherworldly entities, granting Thorvald knowledge at a terrible price.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The true nature of Thorvald's eye and the extent of its powers remain a mystery, one that players may uncover as they interact with this enigmatic figure throughout the campaign.</p>
