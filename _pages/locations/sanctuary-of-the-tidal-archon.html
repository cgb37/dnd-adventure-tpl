name: "Sanctuary of the Tidal Archon"
type: "Tidal Fortress"
description: |
    Rising majestically from the roiling sea, the Sanctuary of the Tidal Archon is an imposing fortress that becomes an isolated island during high tide. Perched atop a rocky outcrop, the fortress's ancient stone walls and towers gleam in the sunlight, reflecting their storied past. Narrow, winding streets lead up to the grand abbey dedicated to the Tidal Archon, with intricate carvings depicting sea legends and celestial beings. The air is thick with the scent of saltwater and the sounds of crashing waves and distant seabirds. During low tide, a stone causeway emerges, connecting the sanctuary to the mainland, only to vanish once again beneath the encroaching sea.

challenges:
    traps: |
      - Hidden pressure plates along the main causeway trigger a mechanism that releases torrents of seawater, sweeping intruders back towards the sea.
    ambush: |
      - A band of spectral knights, bound to protect the abbey, rise from the mist at dusk, their ghostly forms wielding ancient weapons. They use the mist and narrow streets to their advantage, surrounding and ambushing the players.
    puzzles: |
        - A series of runic inscriptions within the abbey must be deciphered to reveal the true name of the Tidal Archon, allowing passage to the inner sanctum. The inscriptions require knowledge of ancient languages and celestial lore.
    hazards: |
        - The tides themselves pose a significant hazard, with fast-rising waters capable of trapping unwary adventurers. Slippery rocks and sudden waves can cause falls and injuries.
secrets:
  - "Beneath the abbey lies a hidden catacomb, where the Tidal Archon's most devout followers are buried alongside a legendary relic said to control the tides."
plot_hooks:
  - The players are sent by a coastal village to retrieve a sacred artifact stolen by the spectral knights and believed to be hidden within the abbey.
  - A mysterious benefactor hires the players to investigate rumors of an ancient treasure buried in the catacombs beneath the sanctuary.
