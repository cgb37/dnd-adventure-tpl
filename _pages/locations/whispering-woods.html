name: "Whispering Woods"
type: "Enchanted Forest"
description: |
  The Whispering Woods is a dense, mist-shrouded forest where magic distorts reality. Ancient, twisted trees with glowing fungi create an eerie luminescence, casting strange shadows on the forest floor. Streams of shimmering water crisscross the landscape, whispering secrets to those who listen closely. Paths shift unpredictably, and the flora and fauna are imbued with arcane energy. The air is thick with the scent of moss and damp earth, occasionally punctuated by the faint smell of ozone from lingering spells.

challenges:
  traps: |
    - Mystic Vines: Triggered by pressure on specific mossy stones, these enchanted vines ensnare intruders, dealing 1d6 piercing damage per round until a DC 14 Strength check is made to escape.
    - Illusory Pitfalls: Illusions that appear as solid ground but reveal deep pits when stepped on, causing 2d6 falling damage.
  ambushes: |
    - Enchanted Beasts: The party may be ambushed by enchanted wildlife such as a pair of phase spiders (CR 3) that can shift in and out of the ethereal plane, using hit-and-run tactics.
  puzzles: |
    - Elemental Runes: A series of stones with elemental symbols must be aligned correctly to unlock a path. The correct alignment requires understanding elemental relationships (e.g., water extinguishes fire).
  hazards: |
    - Magical Mists: Areas of thick mist that induce hallucinations and disorientation, requiring a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw to navigate without getting lost.
