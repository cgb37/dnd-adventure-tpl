<h2>Scene 1: {{ page.title }}</h2>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Village of Bramblewood</p>
<h3>NPCs: Elder Thalia, Villagers</h3>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
    The party arrives in the quaint village of Bramblewood, nestled on the edge of the Whispering Woods. The village is a collection of rustic cottages surrounded by fields and orchards. The air is filled with the scent of blooming flowers and the sounds of villagers going about their daily routines.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
    As the sun sets over Bramblewood, casting a golden hue across the village, the party finds themselves at the heart of their quest. They must gather information about the mysterious Whispering Woods, known for its shifting paths and elusive secrets. The villagers, having lived in the shadow of the forest for generations, hold valuable knowledge that could aid the party in their journey.
</p>
<h3>Events</h3>
<h4>Meeting Elder Thalia</h4>
<p>
    The party seeks out Elder Thalia, the wise and revered leader of Bramblewood. Her cottage is adorned with various herbs and charms, a testament to her knowledge of the natural and magical world. Thalia welcomes the party with a warm smile, her eyes twinkling with curiosity.
</p>
<h4>Dialogue with Thalia</h4>
<p>
    "Ah, travelers, you seek to venture into the Whispering Woods, do you? It is a place of great mystery and danger. Many have entered, but few have returned. The forest is alive with magic, and it guards its secrets jealously. But fear not, for I can provide you with guidance."
</p>
<p>
    Thalia offers the party a map of the forest, marked with cryptic symbols and notes. She explains that the map can help them navigate the shifting paths, but they must be vigilant and perceptive.
</p>
<h4>Gathering Tales from Villagers</h4>
<p>
    The party then moves through the village, speaking with various villagers who share their own tales and warnings. An old woodcutter tells of eerie lights that lead travelers astray, while a farmer recounts the story of a friend who vanished after hearing voices in the mist.

    As the party collects information, they learn of a recent disappearance. A young villager named Elara went missing after claiming to have found a hidden path that leads to an ancient, magical grove deep within the forest. The villagers are anxious, and Thalia fears that Elara's curiosity may have led her into great danger.
