<h3>Setting:</h3>
<p>The adventurers arrive in Bramblewood to find the village square crowded as a public execution is about to take place. Einar, bound in chains, stands accused of treason and heresy, and is about to be burnt at the stake by Hrothgar's men.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>As you enter the village square, the air is thick with tension and the acrid smell of burning wood. Villagers murmur amongst themselves, casting wary glances at the center where a makeshift pyre has been erected. On the platform, Einar stands bound in heavy chains, surrounded by stern-looking soldiers bearing the crest of Hrothgar. The captain of the guard reads out a list of charges, accusing Einar of treason and heresy against the crown.</p>

<p>A torchbearer steps forward, ready to ignite the pyre. Suddenly, an elderly villager steps forward, his one eye glinting with unshed tears. He pleads for Einar's life, revealing himself as Thorvald One-Eye, once advisor to King Bjorn. With a voice heavy with regret, he shares the truth - that Einar is the twin brother of King Hrothgar, separated at birth due to a misunderstood prophecy. This man is no usurper, Thorvald cries, but a prince of Veldan, come to reunite with his brother and fulfill the true meaning of the prophecy - to bring balance and prosperity to our divided land! The crowd gasps, and the soldiers move to silence the old man, but the adventurers are drawn into the unfolding drama.</p>

<h3>Encounter Mechanics:</h3>
<h4>Skill Challenge:</h4>
<p>The adventurers must make a series of DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to convince the crowd and expose the truth.</p>

<h4>Combat Challenge:</h4>
<p>The soldiers attempt to arrest the party and the elderly villager, forcing a combat encounter (use "Guards" CR 1/8 each, and "Knight" CR 3 for the captain).</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>With the adventurers' help, the truth about Hrothgar’s betrayal is revealed to the villagers, who rally to Einar’s side. The captain of the guard is defeated, and Einar is freed from his chains. As he steps down from the pyre, his eyes burn with determination and gratitude. "Thank you," he says, "for believing in justice. Join me, and together we will reclaim the throne and restore peace to this land."</p>

<h3>Persuasive Element:</h3>
<p>The dramatic revelation of betrayal, the imminent threat of execution, and the villagers’ support for Einar create an undeniable sense of urgency and righteousness.
