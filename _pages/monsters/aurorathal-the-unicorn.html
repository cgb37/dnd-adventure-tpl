<ul>
    <li>At will: detect evil and good, druidcraft, pass without trace</li>
    <li>3/day each: calm emotions, dispel evil and good, entangle</li>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The Divine Unicorn is a majestic creature, its pure white coat shimmering with an ethereal glow. Its mane and tail flow like liquid silver, and its spiraled horn radiates a soft, golden light. The air around the unicorn is filled with a sense of peace and serenity, and the scent of blooming flowers follows in its wake. Its eyes, deep and wise, shine with the light of a thousand stars, and its presence alone can soothe the most troubled hearts.</p>

<h4>Tactics</h4>
<p>The Divine Unicorn uses its teleport ability to position itself and its allies strategically, often placing itself between its allies and their foes. It utilizes its Healing Touch to keep its allies in the fight, and its powerful multiattack ensures it can deal with threats directly. The unicorn's legendary actions provide it with the flexibility to respond to threats and protect its allies, particularly with its Shimmering Shield ability.</p>
