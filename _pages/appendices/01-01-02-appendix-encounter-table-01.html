    <h3>Encounter Descriptions:</h3>

    <h4>Green Dragon Wyrmling (CR 2)</h4>
    <p><b>Description:</b> A young green dragon emerges from the mist, its scales shimmering with an eerie green light. It watches the party with cunning eyes, ready to defend its territory.</p>
    <p><b>Mechanics:</b> The dragon uses its breath weapon and cunning tactics to challenge the party. The dense forest provides it with ample cover for ambushes.</p>

    <h4>Will-o'-Wisp (CR 2)</h4>
    <p><b>Description:</b> Floating lights dance through the trees, leading the party deeper into the forest. These malevolent spirits lure travelers to their doom.</p>
    <p><b>Mechanics:</b> The Will-o'-Wisps use their Invisibility and Shock attacks to surprise and disorient the party.</p>

    <h4>Awakened Tree (CR 2)</h4>
    <p><b>Description:</b> An ancient tree groans and creaks as it uproots itself, revealing its sentient nature. It moves to protect the forest from intruders.</p>
    <p><b>Mechanics:</b> The tree uses its powerful branches to bludgeon the party, and its roots to entangle them.</p>

    <h4>Pixies (2) (CR 1/4 each)</h4>
    <p><b>Description:</b> Mischievous pixies flit through the air, giggling and casting illusions to confuse the party.</p>
    <p><b>Mechanics:</b> The pixies use their spells to create distractions and illusions, making it difficult for the party to discern reality.</p>

    <h4>Giant Wolf Spiders (3) (CR 1/4 each)</h4>
    <p><b>Description:</b> Large spiders skitter out from the underbrush, their eyes gleaming in the dim light. They surround the party, looking for an opportunity to strike.</p>
    <p><b>Mechanics:</b> The spiders use their Web and Poison Bite abilities to immobilize and poison the party.</p>

    <h4>Lost Druid offering cryptic advice</h4>
    <p><b>Description:</b> A weathered druid, seemingly lost in the woods, approaches the party. He offers cryptic advice and warnings about the dangers ahead.</p>
    <p><b>Mechanics:</b> The druid provides information and potentially a minor magical boon if the party helps him with a small task.</p>

    <h4>Spectral Deer (use "Specter" template) (CR 1)</h4>
    <p><b>Description:</b> A ghostly deer materializes from the mist, its eyes glowing with an unnatural light. It seems both a guide and a guardian of the forest.</p>
    <p><b>Mechanics:</b> The spectral deer uses its Incorporeal Movement and Life Drain abilities to challenge the party.</p>

    <h4>Giant Centipede (CR 1/4)</h4>
    <p><b>Description:</b> A massive centipede emerges from beneath the fallen leaves, its many legs skittering rapidly. It moves with unsettling speed and aggression.</p>
    <p><b>Mechanics:</b> The centipede uses its Bite and Poison abilities to attack the party.</p>

    <h4>Shambling Mound Sapling (CR 2)</h4>
    <p><b>Description:</b> A smaller, but no less dangerous, version of a shambling mound stirs from the forest floor. It moves with a slow, relentless determination.</p>
    <p><b>Mechanics:</b> The sapling uses its Slam attacks and Engulf ability to overwhelm the party.</p>

    <h4>Enchanted Bear (use "Brown Bear" template with added magical abilities) (CR 1)</h4>
    <p><b>Description:</b> A large bear with a faint magical aura lumbers into view. It seems both protective of the forest and wary of the party.</p>
    <p><b>Mechanics:</b> The bear has additional abilities like a magical roar that causes fear (DC 12 Wisdom save).</p>

    <h4>Hermit Mage (Neutral) offering cryptic advice</h4>
    <p><b>Description:</b> An eccentric mage, living in isolation, appears and offers the party advice. His words are cryptic and filled with warnings about the forest's magic.</p>
    <p><b>Mechanics:</b> The mage can provide a clue or a minor magical item if the party helps him with a task or answers a riddle.</p>
