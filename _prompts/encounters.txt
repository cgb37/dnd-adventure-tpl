Each episode should have an encounter table:
When generating each encounter, follow these steps:
Using the Encounter CR as a guideline, select appropriate monsters from the Monster Manual or create custom monsters following the CR formula:

CR = (Proficiency + AC + Hit Points)/3 + (Damage + Attack Bonus + Spell DC)/2 or 3

Create an interesting encounter setup and narrative description tailored to your campaign's story,
locations, and themes.

The encounters should:
Challenge the party's abilities and resources
Force tactical decisions and innovative problem-solving
Highlight the monsters' unique abilities and environmental factors
Provide motivation beyond just combat, with possibilities for roleplay

Populate the encounter table entry with the following:
Encounter Name
Encounter Description
Encounter Difficulty
Monsters/Enemies
Potential Rewards
Plot Hooks/Story Relevance

Craft each encounter to be a memorable, multi-faceted challenge that blends combat with
environmental puzzles, social encounters, and narrative intrigue.
The goal is to create a collection of dynamic, high-stakes encounters that elevate your campaign
and keep players engaged through clever gameplay and storytelling.
