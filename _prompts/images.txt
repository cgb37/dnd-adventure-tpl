Create a highly detailed top-down 2D battle map for a Dungeons & Dragons game inspired by Mont-Saint-Michel.
The map should be in a 16:9 aspect ratio, with a top-down view and no grid overlay.
The central structure should be a large abbey or fortress with multiple detailed rooms and areas, surrounded by thick
defensive walls with towers at the corners. The entire complex should be encircled by water, with bridges and entry
points connecting it to the mainland. The internal rooms should include detailed interiors like throne rooms, bedrooms,
storage areas, and gardens. The surrounding environment should feature lush greenery, rocks, and pathways, capturing
the shape and construction of Mont-Saint-Michel.
