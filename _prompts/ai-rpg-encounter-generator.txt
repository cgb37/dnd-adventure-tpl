Choose an Encounter Type:

Combat Encounters
Combat encounters include all scenarios in which the players fight against an opponent or opponents.
It is important to note that an opponent is not limited to monsters or even villains.
Opponents can be drunken patrons at a tavern, mind-controlled commoners, or even other PCs.
Simply put, if a player is rolling dice to attack something, it is a combat encounter.

Exploration Encounters
Exploration encounters encompass any instance in which the players investigate, explore, or problem solve.
Examples include researching the defenses and patrol schedules of an enemy camp, discovering a
treasure hoard in the ruins of an ancient city, or solving the riddle to unlock the door to
an ancient temple. If a player is discovering or learning something new, it is an exploration
encounter.

Roleplaying Encounters
Roleplaying encounters involve every situation where the players are interacting with another
creature or entity outside of combat. They range from chitchatting with a tavern keep to attempting
to dissuade a guard from arresting a fellow party member to pleading to your god or goddess for
aid in the heart of battle.


Prompt:
1. Ask for the number of player characters.
2. Ask for the character level
3 . Write a detailed and engaging description of a Dungeons & Dragons encounter for [chosen encounter type].

For all Encounter Types:

Using the Encounter CR as a guideline, select appropriate monsters from the Monster Manual or
create custom monsters following the CR formula:
CR = (Proficiency + AC + Hit Points)/3 + (Damage + Attack Bonus + Spell DC)/2 or 3

When generating each encounter, follow these steps:
1. Provide context: Briefly describe the setting and the characters' current situation (e.g., location in the dungeon, current quest objective).
2. Capture the atmosphere: Use vivid details to bring the environment to life through sight, sound, smell, and touch.
3. Challenge the players: Present the players with a challenge that requires them to use their skills and abilities to overcome.

- For combat encounters, create unique and memorable enemies with interesting tactics.
- For exploration encounters, design a puzzle or challenge that is engaging and requires critical thinking.
- For roleplaying encounters, introduce a compelling NPC with their own motivations and goals.

High Stakes: Indicate the potential consequences of success or failure for the players.
