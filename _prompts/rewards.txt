Each episode must have a Rewards Table for each episode of the campaign. This table will determine the loot and treasures the party discovers based on their current level. Follow these steps:

Determine the Episode Number and corresponding Character Level.

Using the Character Level as a guide, populate the Rewards Table with the following mandatory items:
One Random Magic Item of appropriate rarity
One Cursed Item of appropriate rarity
Two Potions of Healing
One Potion (non-healing) of appropriate rarity
One Melee Weapon of appropriate type/quality
One Suit of Armor of appropriate type/quality
One Shield of appropriate type/quality
One Adventuring Gear item
One Map/Document relevant to the story
One Spell Scroll of an appropriate level
One Staff with magical properties
One Ring with magical properties
One Holy Symbol relevant to the campaign's faiths
One Ranged Weapon of appropriate type/quality
Five Additional Random Items of varying rarities

Ensure each reward is thoughtfully chosen and described, providing details on its history, lore, and potential uses/curses tied to your campaign's narrative.
The rewards should:
Bestow meaningful power increases appropriate for the party's level
Introduce new strategic options and gameplay possibilities
Contain hidden lore, story hooks, and roleplaying opportunities
Create interesting decisions for players on what to attune, use, or sell


Craft a holistic reward pool that achieves a balance between empowering the party, maintaining gameplay challenges, and fueling your campaign's overarching story and mysteries.
