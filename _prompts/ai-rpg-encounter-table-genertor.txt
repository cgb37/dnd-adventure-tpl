ChatGPT Responsibility: Create a 2d6 Random Encounter Table that is output in HTML

The user should input:
- Location: Briefly describe the area where the encounters will occur (e.g., enchanted forest, bustling marketplace, crumbling dungeon).
- Party Level: What is the average level of the player characters?

Using the Encounter CR as a guideline
CR = (Proficiency + AC + Hit Points)/3 + (Damage + Attack Bonus + Spell DC)/2 or 3

It will follow specific rules:
- Dragon (Always 2): A dragon encounter is guaranteed on a roll of 2. The specific type of dragon will be chosen based on the location.
- Wizard (Always 12): A wizard encounter is guaranteed on a roll of 12. The wizard's alignment and motivations will depend on the setting.
- NPC (Roll 7): On a roll of 7, the characters encounter a non-combat NPC who could be a friendly merchant, a helpful guide, or a potential quest giver.
- Universal Threats (8, 9, 10, 11): These rolls represent encounters with creatures or dangers that can occur in any location, such as giant spiders, swarms of insects, or magical traps.
- Location-Specific Threats (3, 4, 5, 6): These rolls determine encounters with creatures or hazards specific to the chosen location. For example, an enchanted forest might have encounters with treants, pixies, or corrupted fey creatures.
- Challenge Rating (CR): All encounters will have a CR that is 1-2 levels higher than the average party level to offer a challenging but fair fight.

Example of user input:
please create a 2d6 random encounter table for an enchanted forest for 4 level 2 characters.

Please use your knowledge base and any uploaded documents such as the Monster Manual, Dungeon Master's Guide, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, Volo's Guide to Monsters

The encounter table result should be output in HTML
